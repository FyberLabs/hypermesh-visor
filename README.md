# hypermesh-visor

`hypermesh-visor` is a local Linux daemon a supervisor starts for a desktop session. Open a session, then call view, watch, listen, mouse, and type. Calls without a live session fail. It is not a virtual machine. This version is Linux only.

Purpose, recipes, agent, skills, and secrets are sent when the session opens. Only secrets included in that call are loaded. URL, MCP, chain, and IPFS sources are part of the session call and are not fetched.

## Linux build and tests

Stable Rust. Tests do not need a display server.

```bash
cargo test
cargo build --release
./target/release/hypermesh-visor --listen 127.0.0.1:9847
```

`--listen` must be a loopback address. Run the daemon as the logged-in user, not as root. It prints `listening 127.0.0.1:9847` when the socket is up.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9847/session \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"purpose":"look at the desktop","recipes":[],"agent":{"name":"local","instructions":""},"skills":[]}'
```
